# There are five main SELinux seuser values:
#   guest_u: - no X windows, no sudo, and no networking
#   xguest_u: - same as guest_u, but X and web connectivity is allowed
#   user_u: - same as xguest_u, but networking isn’t restricted
#   staff_u: - same as user_u, but sudo is allowed (su isn’t allowed)
#   unconfined_u: - full access
# add users do not delete users that left, comment the lines
# staff and wheel users need an ssh pub key.
